# Design Patterns

A collection of C++ projects implementing various object-oriented design patterns.

## How to run a project?
Go to the projects directory (i.e. ObserverPattern)
- `install.sh` : compile and build
- `run.sh` : run the binary
### Compile and Build
```bash
cd ObserverPattern
source install.sh
```

### Run
```bash
source run.sh
```

### Creational patterns
These patterns provide object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
